# AM5650-Project
This repository contains code used to solve the coupled wake and structural oscillations described in the paper "Coupling of structure and wake oscillators in vortex-induced vibrations" by M.L. Facchinetti, E. de Langre, and F. Biolley.

README

This repository contains the referenced papers and a report explaining the results of the code along with the code.
The code main.m should be a single executable file on MATLAB (all necessary function files are also added)
